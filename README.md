# Optimization of Machine Downtime

## Project Overview

### Client:
Our client is one of the leading vehicle fuel pump manufacturers. The fuel pumps manufactured are essential for transferring fuel at high velocity, which directly impacts vehicle performance. The faster the fuel is pushed, the higher the vehicleâ€™s speed.

### Business Problem:
The machines responsible for manufacturing these pumps are experiencing unplanned downtimes, leading to significant productivity losses. Reducing this downtime is critical to maintaining efficiency and ensuring that manufacturing processes are not delayed.

### Business Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to **minimize unplanned machine downtime**. By achieving this, we can increase manufacturing efficiency and ensure that productivity remains high.

### Business Constraint:
In addition to minimizing unplanned downtime, the solution must also aim to **minimize maintenance costs**, ensuring that the reduction in downtime is achieved without inflating the costs of upkeep.

### Success Criteria:
- **Business Success Criteria:** Achieve a reduction in unplanned downtime by at least **10%**.
- **Economic Success Criteria:** Secure cost savings of at least **$1M** through reduced downtime and optimized maintenance operations.

## Solution Approach
The project will involve data analysis, predictive maintenance strategies, and process optimization to identify root causes of downtime and develop solutions to mitigate them. The goal is to use advanced analytics and monitoring tools to predict and prevent unplanned machine downtime.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis:** Python, MySQL
- **Visualization:** Google Colab

## Conclusion
This project aims to deliver tangible improvements in manufacturing efficiency by minimizing unplanned downtime and reducing costs. By implementing data-driven solutions, the goal is to enhance both productivity and profitability.
